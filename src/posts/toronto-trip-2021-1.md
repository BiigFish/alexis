Hi everybody, 

I have been considering signing up for a barre class for ages.... Well, maybe a week. But I've been waiting for the "right day" to start which essentially means I probably would have never signed up. I ran into Morgan after school today and was telling her about my goal and she was super excited and offered to do it with me but not before getting into shape a bit beforehand. 

Now I had some qualms about this since I've been known to not follow through on fitness related things. I started off the year attempting to follow a 30 day yoga challenge but that quickly came to a stop after MAYBE two weeks. I think it was because I had no stakes in it, there was nothing keeping me on schedule other than myself. I also didn't really enjoy it as much as I had enjoyed yoga before, I like a power yoga that keeps you moving and the program I was following was more slow and mostly for beginners - it wasn't what I was looking for at all. And lastly, I was doing yoga at home with not a lot of space and multiple pieces of furniture to move around so I could stretch in all directions. Motivation was also an issue, I commonly left yoga to the last thing to check off on my list meaning I wouldn't get around to it until late at night when I was already exhausted from a full day. Needless to say, the 30 day yoga challenge was a no-go. 

However, I think back to last semester when I was taking a yoga class at the university, it was fun, I enjoyed it because it was challenging, and I went to every class. Partly because I liked my instructor, but mostly because I had paid for the class and HAD to go. I also liked the routine and it got me out of the house on Monday nights. It was great. 

So this was my though process going into Barre classes. I needed: 

1. Something I'm paying for

2. A routine 

3. Classes that won't be boring 

4. Something not in my apartment

Which I thought could all be checked off by this class. But Morgan is right, I think I need a baseline level of fitness before I can truly enjoy and benefit from barre classes. 

Going into this 28 day challenge, I'm excited to be doing it with a friend by my side and feel motivated to complete it because there is an end goal which isn't necessarily weight loss. I'm hoping that documenting the challenge will help by keeping myself accountable as well. 

See you next week with updates :)
