Utopia Avenue is a book (and also a novel!) about the strangest band that came out of London in 1967. The book starts with their humble beginnings being a rag tag group of weirdos, and follows the band through their struggles and adventures towards stardom. The only caveat, it’s all made up from the mind of author David Mitchell.

That’s not to say the novel is fantasy. While the band, Utopia Avenue, may be fake, everything else is factual. The band weaves through history as they interact with historical figures and perform at famous concerts that have shaped musical culture. It creates an effective portrait of an era and immerses the reading into the life of rock n roll during the psychedelic 60s.

This particular blend of fiction and non-fiction is quite strange. The book causally introduces various historical people in the same manner it would introduce a fictional character. A person who doesn’t have much rock n roll knowledge would probably not be able to differentiate fact from fiction. However, anyone that is into rock n roll will get a kick at the new perspective of the archival characters and events. Whether the reader understands these historical references or not, Utopia Avenue will be an enjoyable read.
